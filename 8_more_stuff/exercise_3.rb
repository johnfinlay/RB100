# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# Exception handing is catching and reporting errors inside of your code.
# It allows a graceful way to deal with known errors, allows the program
# to continue execution, and allows a way to effectively communicate
# with the user regarding "expected" errors(data validation)
